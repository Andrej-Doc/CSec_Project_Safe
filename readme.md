## Usage

Before proceeding with the installation, make sure you have a global installation of node-gyp, and GCC >= 5 / Clang >= 3.3 if you are compiling your own binaries on Windows, you need to compile under Visual Studio 2015 or newer.

node-argon2 is compatible and tested with Node >=18.0.0.

To install node-gyp globally, run the following command:
```bash
npm install -g node-gyp
```

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```

To start the server, run:
```bash
node index.js
```
